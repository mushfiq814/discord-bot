# Discord Bot

First test with discord bot.
This bot will be used to aid in setting up events for members in different timezones. Members will be able to:
* create events with time specified
* look up created events and get times in their own timezones
* convert given time to other timezones by using saved timezone codes
* create and edit saved timezone codes
